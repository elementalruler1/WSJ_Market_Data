# WSJ_Market_Data

Still working on this project. It currently only extracts the NYSE biggest percentage gainers. I still need to add functionality to extract biggest percentage losses (just need to setup the target and check xpaths) as well as an article scraper. I may add a CLI in the future. Needs to be refactored.
